This is a decentralized voting application built on the Ethereum blockchain, modeled to suit the needs of the Students' Union elections at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.

<br/>
**Features:**
- Support for multi-ballot elections, where there can be more than one designations. Each voter gets one vote per designation.
- Web application with Voter and Admin Dashboards. Users can cast votes, while administrators can add candidates and designations, and tally total votes.
- Tallied votes are displayed according to the selected designation, in both tabular and graphical form.  

<br/>
_Note:_ The contract **does not** ensure that newly added candidates or posts are distinct. Therefore, this must currently be handled in the front-end. As a side effect, this allows candidates to contest for multiple designations at the same time.
