The following features are under consideration, and may be present in future revisions.

1. **Granular Voter Permissions**: Currently voters can vote for all posts (though they aren't required to do so), but there may be cases where they are eligible to vote only for some posts out of the pool.

2. **Candidate / Post Uniqueness Check**: Can be enforced in the contract, and the method call can emit an event, similar to the `vote` function.
